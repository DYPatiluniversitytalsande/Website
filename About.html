           The Foodbox started off on the 1st of September 2020 as a small lunchroom located in Agriport. The Foodbox is located on an industrial area. The target group of the Foodbox includes the agricultural companies in the area, as well as the data center construction companies from the UK, US, and Ireland.

           The Foodbox is a restaurant where people come to enjoy a traditional English or Irish breakfast. Additionally, we are the only restaurant cooking for the large US tech companies who use large UK/Irish mechanical and electrical companies to build data centers. Our menu is custom-made to serve the expats, and our off-site restaurant is ideal for client meetings, toolbox meetings, or escaping the hectic surroundings of the construction site. We also accommodate management meetings and safety courses such as VCA. We have facilities to charge electric cars, plenty of parking space free of charge, and office space available across the road. Additionally, we offer storage space for our data center clients.
